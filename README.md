## How to deploy Open Liberty Operator with an ArgoCD Application
1. Install the OpenShift GitOps operator in OpenShift UI into the `openshift-gitops` namespace.
2. Grant permissions for the GitOps operator to view across the cluster. In this example, access is required to create the `open-liberty` namespace.
```
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin  system:serviceaccount:openshift-gitops:openshift-gitops-argocd-application-controller -n openshift-gitops
```
3. Choose the Kustomize artifacts folder to pull from the [Open Liberty Operator releases page](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator/tree/main/deploy/releases). In this example, I use Kustomize files from `deploy/releases/1.4.3/kustomize/base`.
3. Install Open Liberty Operator
  - Install for `OwnNamespace` mode:
   `oc apply -f kustomize-open-liberty-operator-own-namespace`
  - Install for `AllNamespaces` mode:
  `oc apply -f kustomize-open-liberty-operator-all-namespaces`
4. Check the `olo-controller-manager` `Pod` running in the `open-liberty` namespace. 
4. (Optional) Ignore runtime artifacts generated by Open Liberty Operator such as the `open-liberty-operator` ConfigMap by editing the Application custom resource.
